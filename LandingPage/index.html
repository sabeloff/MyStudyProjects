 <h2>Our price</h2>
 <p>Average Cost Of Software Development<br>
    When you question IT firms how much software development costs, you often get the typical answer of ‘it depends’. For startup owners, having a vague answer isn’t helpful for budget planning, yet it isn’t hard to put down a solid figure without detailed discussions.
    There are many factors that determine the cost of building a piece of software. A development agency would need to run through the project requirements with the client before providing a cost estimate. 
    Obviously, a simple app that requires very little user interaction or backend processing will be cheaper to develop. Meanwhile, a complex application that involves financial transactions, heavy interaction, and connected to external systems will be much more expensive to develop.
    Software development cost isn’t merely about the scale or complexity of the app. If you’re building a simple app but with dozens of different screens, the cost may rival those of more complicated apps. 
    Ultimately, it comes down to the people-hour and the technology stack involved in building the software. 
    Based on our experience, the ballpark range of software development<b> costs is between $50,000 to $250,000.</b> The lower price tag fits a simple app that takes less than 700 hours to develop. If you’re building a multi-platform app with a server-side application, the fee is likely in 6 figures.</p>
